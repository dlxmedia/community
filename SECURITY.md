### ‚ö°Ô∏è Posting a Vulnerability 

Report security bugs via [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/eplay).
> Our program is currently on `invite-only` mode, please contact <security@eplay.com> to be invited

Normally your report will be acknowledged within 5 days, and you'll receive
a more detailed response to your report within 10 days indicating the
next steps in handling your submission. These timelines may extend when
our triage volunteers are away on holiday, particularly at the end of the
year.

After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep
you informed of the progress being made towards a fix and full announcement,
and may ask for additional information or guidance surrounding the reported
issue.

### üí∞ ePlay Bug Bounty Program

Eplay engages in an official bug bounty program for security researchers and responsible public disclosures.  The program is managed through the HackerOne platform. See <https://hackerone.com/eplay> for further details.


### ‚õ® Safe harbor

**ePlay** supports safe harbor for security researchers who:

*   Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data,
    and interruption or degradation of our services
*   Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the
    account holder.
    If you do encounter Personally Identifiable Information (PII) contact us
    immediately, do not proceed with access, and immediately purge any local
    information
*   Provide us with a reasonable amount of time to resolve vulnerabilities prior
    to any disclosure to the public or a third-party
*   We will consider activities conducted consistent with this policy to
    constitute ‚Äúauthorised‚Äù conduct and will not pursue civil action or initiate
    a complaint to law enforcement.
    We will help to the extent we can if legal action is initiated by a third
    party against you

Please submit a report to us before engaging in conduct that may be inconsistent
with or unaddressed by this policy.
