## üî§ Terminology and Scope

**What defines a "maintainer"?**
> A maintainer is anyone that interacts with the community on behalf of this project. Amount of code written is not a qualifier. A maintainer may include those who solely help in support roles such as in resolving issues, improving documentation, administrating or moderating forums/chatrooms, or any other non-coding specific roles. Maintainers also include those that are responsible for the building and upkeep of the project.

**What defines a "community member"?**
> Anyone interacting with this project directly, including maintainers.

**What is the scope of these guidelines?**
> These guidelines apply only to this project and forms of communication directly related to it, such as issue trackers, forums, chatrooms, and in person events specific to this project. If a member is violating these guidelines outside of this project or on other platforms, that is beyond our scope and any grievances should be handled on those platforms.

**Discussing the guidelines:**
> Discussions around these guidelines, improving, updating, or altering them, is permitted so long as the discussions do not violate any existing guidelines.

## ‚ùáÔ∏è Guidelines

### Guidelines for community members

This project is technical in nature and not based around any particular non-technical ideology. As such, communication that is based primarily around ideologies unrelated to the technologies used by this repository are not permitted.

Any discussion or communication that is primarily focused around an ideology, be it about race, gender, politics, religion, or anything else non-technical, is not allowed. Everyone has their own ideological preferences, beliefs, and opinions. We do not seek to marginalize, exclude, or judge anyone for their ideologies. To prevent conflict between those with differing or opposing ideologies, all communication on these subjects are prohibited. Some discussions around these topics may be important, however this project is not the proper channel for these discussions.

### Guidelines for maintainers

* Maintainers must abide by the same rules as all other community members mentioned above. However, in addition, maintainers are held to a higher standard, explained below.
* Maintainers should answer all questions politely.
* If someone is upset or angry about something, it's probably because it's difficult to use, so thank them for bringing it to your attention and address ways to solve the problem. Maintainers should focus on the content of the message, and not on how it was delivered.
* A maintainer should seek to update members when an issue they brought up is resolved.
